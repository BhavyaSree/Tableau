Click on sheet1

As we are creating map to view how the states are performing, we need to check the profit attained in all states in the country

For this, first we need to drag country to white space, to create country map.

![Country](Screens/country-0.png)

secondly, we drag state of province to note the states as per data

![States](Screens/states-0.png)

Thirdly, as want a map with respect to profit, drag profit on color (to represent different profits with different colors) and drag profits on labels (to represent the profit value of that particular state).

![Profit](Screens/profits-0.png)

We can change the font size on clicking on label and changing the font size.  

### 2. What are the most profitable and least profitable states.

By pointing on the specific state, we can get the information about the state name and profit.
